### How Work???

- Require Node.js version 16.15.1

1. Clone the project from [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/arq-gabo/javascript-calculator)
2. `npm install` - for install dependency

4. `npm run build` - for run production enviroment

### Features

- It was used React.js for create user interface, the components are functional components, was used react-router for routes of the different pages and axios library for request data api
- This project was starting using VITE
